	 * This class is implemented by any classField that you want to sync.
	 * What this will cause then is simple. It will call these functions and allow you to sync indirectly stuff.
	 * Note: When a field class implements this it will be not sync normally.
	 * And it will be not replaced. Field has to be always there and not a Null!
	 * But it will still be calling the Function in the INetworkUpdateListener with the field name
