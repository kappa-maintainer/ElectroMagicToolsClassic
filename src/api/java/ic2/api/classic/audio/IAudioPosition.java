 * This class allows you to make custom AudioPosition classes
 * which do not have to be static so you can make moving sounds with this class
 * Things to know: This class does not get saved and does not receive a update tick
 * so if you want to have a moving sound you have to update it yourself.
 * This class is cached in the IAudioSource and calls getPosition/getWorld every tick
